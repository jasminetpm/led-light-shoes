LED shoes built with Arduino micro-controller

I made a pair of shoes that light up based on the amount of pressure on the soles. I made a pair of pressure sensors using velostat, which is a material that allows electricity to flow through based on the amount of pressure applied on it, as well as conductive thread. I placed these pressure sensors at the toes and heels of my shoe soles.

Based on the amount of pressure applied on these areas (toes and heels), different intensities and colours of LED lights would display on the shoes. These LED lights are programmed with Arduino code, using a FLORA micro-controller. The micro-controller is sewn onto the flap of the shoes and the circuit is powerd by rechargeable battery packs.
